# Welcome to my portfolio!

If you are here for **content writing**, click [here to see a PDF]([https:](https://github.com/Nathaniel-A-Miller/Portfolio/blob/beb97a4ac4a3434b171235d9a39b80e22d729282/Revised%20content%20portfolio.pdf).

For my **technical writing**, I have two Jupyter notebooks showcasing my work with code. They're both in this repo. Have a look!
To reproduce the code in an executable environment, check them out on Binder by clicking the badge:

The first, **"Cheat at Trig with Python,"** takes a trig problem from a Khan Academy video and shows the reader how it can
be coded in Python, and then builds on this to show how we can take inputs from the user to answer _any_ question of the kind
discussed in the video.

The second, **"Visualization Final Project for Udacity PISA Education Test Scores"** is a project from my Udacity Data
Analysis nanondegree. I used matplotlib in Python along with some other Python libraries to visualize data on education in China and the USA.

The data comes from PISA 2012. Some of the questions the it looks at are: are Chinese students really better at math? How strongly does
parents' educational level correlate to their childrens' success in China vs America? Do nerdy students (high-performing
readers) feel at more of a social disadvantage in China vs America?

I cleaned the data and wrote all the code for this, but I only used summary statistics to explore the data, although my
coursework involved learning about regression capabilities to explore correlation with more precision.
