# Final Visualization Project: US and Chinese Educational Systems

This GitHub repository is a work in progress!

Right now you can look at the Jupyter notebook "Visualization Final Project for Udacity PISA Education Test Scores"
and see some of my work I created during my Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree.

I used matplotlib in Python along with some other Python libraries to visualize data on education in China and the USA.

Some of the questions the data can help answer are: are Chinese students really better at math? How strongly does
parents' educational level correlate to their childrens' success in China vs America? Do nerdy students (high-performing
readers) feel at more of a social disadvantage in China vs America?

I cleaned the data and wrote all the code for this, but I only used summary statistics to explore the data, although my
coursework involved learning about regression capabilities to explore correlation with more precision.
