    "We'll be looking at how to code a simple trigonometic problem using Python. We'll evaluate  $cos(a+b)$, the sum of the cosine of two angles in a triangle using an identity of the cosine angle addition formula. This lesson is based on a video from Sal Khan's Khan Academy that you can find embedded (hit ctrl+enter in the cell below) if you want to watch it first."
